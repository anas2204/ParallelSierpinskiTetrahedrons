# ParallelSierpinskiTetrahedrons
A few practice examples of creating Sierpinski Tetrahedrons using OpenCL and OpenGL

I just wanted to practice how to integrate OpenCL while generating graphics.

ConsoleApplication3 - Asks for the number of subdivision of Tetrahedrons, and divides it accordingly. All the Tetrahedrons are divided in parallel

ConsoleApplication4 - Was trying to create curves based on level of subdivision.

Direct executables of 64-bit Windows can be run from the "Run Application" folders
