# ParallelSierpinskiTetrahedrons
A few practice examples of creating Sierpinski Tetrahedrons using OpenCL and OpenGL

<b>ConsoleApplication3</b> 
Asks for the number of subdivision of Tetrahedrons, and divides it accordingly. All the Tetrahedrons are divided in parallel

<b>ConsoleApplication4</b> 
Trying to create curves based on level of subdivision. The farther the image is, less is the level of detail.

Direct executables of 64-bit Windows can be run from the "Run Application" folders
